This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in Python related to handling empty lists and non-numeric inputs within a function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The provided code showcases the error, and a solution is proposed to improve robustness.  The solution uses a try-except block to catch exceptions such as TypeError gracefully and return an appropriate value, instead of letting the program crash. This approach makes the code more resilient to unexpected input.
